🔧 **Solutions:**
   1. Add recipients to allow list: `add_to_gmail_allow_list`
   2. Save as draft instead: `draft_gmail_message`
   3. Set GMAIL_ELICITATION_FALLBACK=allow to send anyway
   4. Set GMAIL_ELICITATION_FALLBACK=draft to auto-save drafts

    Sends an email using the user's Gmail account with support for HTML formatting and multiple recipients.

    Features elicitation for recipients not on the allow list - if any recipient
    is not on the configured allow list, the tool will ask for confirmation
    before sending the email.

    Args:
        ctx: FastMCP context for elicitation support
        to: Recipient email address(es) - can be a single string or list of strings
        subject: Email subject
        body: Email body content. Usage depends on content_type:
            - content_type="plain": Contains plain text only
            - content_type="html": Contains HTML content (plain text auto-generated for Gmail)
            - content_type="mixed": Contains plain text (HTML goes in html_body parameter)
        user_google_email: The user's Google email address for Gmail access. If None, uses the current authenticated user from FastMCP context (auto-injected by middleware).
        content_type: Content type - controls how body and html_body are used:
            - "plain": Plain text email (backward compatible)
            - "html": HTML email - put HTML content in 'body' parameter
            - "mixed": Dual content - plain text in 'body', HTML in 'html_body' (default)
        html_body: HTML content when content_type="mixed". Ignored for other content types.
        cc: Optional CC recipient(s) - can be a single string or list of strings
        bcc: Optional BCC recipient(s) - can be a single string or list of strings

    Returns:
        str: Confirmation message with the sent email's message ID

    Examples:
        # Plain text (backward compatible)
        send_gmail_message(ctx, "user@example.com", "Subject", "Plain text body")

    Create a draft forward of a Gmail message with HTML formatting preservation.

    This function creates a draft forward of an existing Gmail message while preserving
    the original HTML formatting as much as possible. It includes the original message
    headers (From, Date, Subject, To, Cc).

    Args:
        message_id: The ID of the message to forward
        to: Recipient email address(es) - can be a single string or list of strings
        user_google_email: The user's Google email address for Gmail access. If None, uses the current authenticated user from FastMCP context (auto-injected by middleware).
        body: Optional additional message body to add before the forwarded content. Usage depends on content_type:
            - content_type="plain": Contains plain text only
            - content_type="html": Contains HTML content
            - content_type="mixed": Contains plain text (HTML goes in html_body parameter)
        content_type: Content type - controls how body and html_body are used:
            - "plain": Plain text forward (original HTML converted to plain text)
            - "html": HTML forward - preserves original HTML formatting
            - "mixed": Dual content - plain text in 'body', HTML in 'html_body' (default, recommended)
        html_body: HTML content when content_type="mixed". Ignored for other content types.
        cc: Optional CC recipient(s) - can be a single string or list of strings
        bcc: Optional BCC recipient(s) - can be a single string or list of strings

    Returns:
